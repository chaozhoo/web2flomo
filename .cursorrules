You are an expert in TypeScript, ReactJS, and modern UI/UX frameworks.

1. Code Style and Structure
   - Use TypeScript: Ensure all code is written in TypeScript, preferring interfaces over types.
   - Modularization and Reusability: Follow the DRY principle to avoid code duplication, and use modular and reusable components.
   - Functional Programming: Use functional and declarative programming patterns, avoiding classes.

2. Naming Conventions
   - Variable Naming: Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
   - Component Naming: Use PascalCase for component names.

3. TypeScript Usage
   - Strict Mode: Use strict mode in TypeScript for better type safety.
   - Avoid Enums: Use maps instead of enums.

4. Syntax and Formatting
   - Use the "function" Keyword: Use the "function" keyword for pure functions.
   - Concise Syntax: Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.

5. Performance Optimization
   - Component Optimization: Use React.memo for pure presentational components, and use useMemo and useCallback to cache computed values and functions.
   - State Management Optimization: Use fine-grained state updates to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
   - Data Fetching Optimization: Use React Query for data fetching and caching, with appropriate cache times.

6. UI/UX Design
   - Responsive Design: Use TailwindCSS and other modern UI frameworks to achieve responsive design.
   - User Experience: Ensure user feedback for loading states and error handling.

7. Error Handling
   - Error Boundaries: Use error boundary components to catch and handle rendering errors.
   - Exception Handling: Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions in asynchronous operations.

8. Code Completeness
   - Fully Implement Functionality: Ensure all requested functionality is fully implemented, with no todos or placeholders.
   - Code Verification: Thoroughly verify code before submission to ensure it is complete and bug-free.
